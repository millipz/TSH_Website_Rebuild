Extensive Residential development including retirement living apartments, 70 bed care home and conversion of Farm House and immediate outbuildings to residential development.

The design detail incorporates heritage led design language in order to tie into the historic local character of the site and its immediate environs.

The Masterplan also includes public open spaces and has been carefully developed to respond to and harness existing landscape and planting features to ensure that the new development sits comfortably within the landscape.
