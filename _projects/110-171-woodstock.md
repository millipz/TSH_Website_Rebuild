A contemporary extension and garden studio to a North Oxford, Edwardian House. Care was taken to respect the hierarchy between the existing Edwardian house and the new, contemporary extension by introducing glazed connection between new and old.  Whilst the sculptural ceiling structure, comprised of interlocking timber members, provides further visual interest.
