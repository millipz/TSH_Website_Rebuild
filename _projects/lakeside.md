Designed with multiple bespoke features, such as timber lined window boxes, an oak staircase and dramatic double height glazing, the houses have been designed to perform sustainably whilst providing a high level of comfort, with triple glazed external windows, doors and an MVHR system distributing tempered fresh air to every room.
