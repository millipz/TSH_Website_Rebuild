TSH were invited to design a landmark building on the sitye of a former Gasw holder.  TSH proposed two schemes, each responding to the site's industrial history whilst also reinforcing the connection between building and a new landscape, with extensive planting to encourage biodiversity.  The different schemes proposed provide office space at ground floor with residential accommodation above.
