Described by the Oxford Design Review Panel as 'High Quality Architecture' the major Quad Development project at St. Edward's School will complete 'Simeon's Dream', the Masterplan vision set out at the inauguration of the school's North Oxford site in 1873.

The project will provide vital teaching and library accommodation, providing state of the art learning facilities for the school's students. Alongside this the existing 1970's Hall will be demolished to allow for the construction of a magnificent replacement 1000 seater school assembly hall.

These developments will alleviate pressure on Existing Grade II Listed 'Big School', allowing for a sensitive refurbishment, aligned with the creation of new formal and informal external spaces between buildings, including several new external courtyards and an internal glass link between the new hall and the rear of Big School.


*Completion: 2020*
