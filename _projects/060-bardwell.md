18 Bardwell Road is an exemplary eco-refurbishment of a large Victorian property in the North Oxford Conservation Area.

The reconfiguration of the building provides 20 hotel-style ensuite graduate bedrooms, with bespoke fitted furniture and oak veneered panelling. The building has been insulated throughout with ecologically friendly wood-fibre insulation and lime plaster, with existing window architraves and other internal details carefully removed and refitted. Double glazed secondary glazing has been fitted to vastly improve the performance of the existing fabric, while minimising the affect on the external appearance. The building is fitted throughout with MVHR (mechanical ventilation with heat recovery), and all heating and hot water is provided by air source heat pumps, to allow the building to lower its emissions even futher as the National Grid decarbonises.
