Wishing to expand their boarding facilities, Abingdon School invited TSH architects to enter into a closed design competition for proposals to extend provide the school with new boarding accommodation.
 
TSH offered the School two alternative proposals on two different sites:
1) An extension to an existing boarding house
2) The creation of a brand-new boarding house. Following the ‘mansion set in park’ architectural order of its school context, both proposals capitalise upon the connection between building and landscape with both buildings set around central garden space.
