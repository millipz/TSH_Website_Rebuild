TSH were invited to design a landmark building on the site of a former gasometer. TSH proposed two schemes, each responding to the site's industrial history whilst also reinforcing the connection between building and a new landscape, with extensive planting to encourage biodiversity.  Each scheme provides office space at ground floor with residential accommodation above.
