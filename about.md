TSH Architects was formed in 1991 by Graeme Towle, Andrew Spurring and Nick Hardy. Now led by Nick Hardy.

The practice has established a deserved reputation for producing innovative design solutions, largely in the education and residential sectors.

The staff at TSH Architects work hard, but like to play as well, so every winter the whole office decants to the alps for a long weekend snowboarding and every summer to surf in Devon.
