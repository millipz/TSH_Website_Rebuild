St Benedict's School is a voluntary-aided, co-educational Catholic high school, founded in 1963. Being an 'outstanding school', St. Benedict's was able to apply for a sixth form centre under the presumption process to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) and Local Authority.

The bid, for which TSH Architects prepared scheme designs, was successful and the resulting Sixth Form Centre provides excellent facilities, further enhancing the schools reputation.

The 2050mÂ², 3 storey building accommodates 200 sixth form students, providing a range of facilities including flexible teaching space , a small lecture theatre/ cinema, dance/ drama studio, science laboratories and a rooftop garden with a contemplation pavilion.

The focal point of the building is a two storey multi-use hall, overlooked by a first floor balcony and the library.
