Jubilee House is a new boarding house for 60 girls set on the edge of playing fields at St Edward’s School. The house has en-suite rooms, shared rooms Housemistresses’ Matron’s and Assistant Housemistress’ accommodation. The design features a three storey atrium which is a departure from the usual corridor approach providing a spectacular communal environment.

> Designed by pupils, Housemistresses, matrons and the School’s psychologist, the House encompasses the best ideas for producing a warm and friendly atmosphere in which all year groups can mix and support each other. I feel very privileged to have been able to grow this new project from our six special Lower Sixth girls to a full House. We know that the Boarding House is the girls’ home while they are at school and Jubilee has all the mod-cons needed for a teenage girl.
