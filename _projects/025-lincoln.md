The Mitre and Turl Street is a complex of historic buildings owned by Lincoln college, including the Mitre Pub, which dates back to the 17th Century.

This project involved a sensitive renovation of the student accommodation on the upper floors of the Grade II and Grade II* listed buildings, including the addition of many ensuites and high-end fixtures and fittings throughout, whilst completely reimagining the existing convoluted access to the accommodation, with a new central raised deck.

Alongside the refurbishment of the external fabric and the internal reconfiguration, the project also features a new stone lodge building which provides a single secure point of entrance and a carefully crafted college presence on Turl Street.

*Completed: 2021*
