TSH architects are currently working on the design of Two new boarding Houses, each accommodating 64 pupils, for Charterhouse, Godalming.  The new boarding houses have been designed to be identical, but are mirrored on the East-West axis, following the pattern of development of existing 1970s Boarding Houses.

At the heart of each house is a double height common room, which will have direct access out onto 3 sided courtyard, which opens to the extensive school fields beyond.  The design includes multiple different room types to accommodate the schools needs, with the architectural design being inspired by the steeply pitched roofs and towers of the magnificent Victorian Gothic architecture of the original school buildings.

Planning Permission for the scheme was received in August, with the scheme currently on site.  The two new boarding houses will be complete for summer 2021.

Due for Completion: July 2021
