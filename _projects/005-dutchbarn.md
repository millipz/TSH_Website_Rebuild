We were appointed to convert an existing Dutch Barn into 4600 ftÂ² of office accommodation for this site within the Oxford Green Belt.

Whilst the steel frame was an important feature of the building, it was in poor condition and could not be re-used.  Instead we built a new frame of the same shape and size in the same position.  The frame is best appreciated from the inside of the building where it is on display to the open-plan offices right up to the curved ceiling.

The existing drystone wall has been rebuilt in its original position and forms the buildings skin along the west elevation

*Completed: August 2022*
