The development of a 1.97 hectare site in a semi-rural location to the north of Oxford will see existing facilities for the rehabilitation centre refurbished focussing horticultural therapy for new residents. The mixed use development includes a 70 bed care home and 10 private residential dwellings.
The design arrangement of the new dwellings have drawn inspiration from nearby Oxfordshire villages, with the new houses arranged on the site around a central ‘Village green’ with stone walls bounding enclosed spaces tying the buildings to the landscape. Varied plot positions provide open landscaped areas and groupings of buildings that incorporate a continuous building line. This design approach has also been adopted to help soften the massing of the care home given that care home design tends to result in a more concentrated building mass.
